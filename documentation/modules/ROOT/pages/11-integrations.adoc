NOTE: In RHACS the Scanner component only scans those images that are not already scanned by other integrated vulnerability scanners. It means that if you have integrated Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes with other vulnerability scanners, Scanner checks and uses the scanning results from the integrated scanner if available.

== Integrate RHACS with the Internal Openshift Registry 

Idea originally posted by Mark Roberts in https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/using-red-hat-advanced-cluster-security-with-the-openshift-registry[this great blog post], and adapt to consume internally 

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security can be used to scan images held within OpenShift image streams (the OpenShift registry). 

This can be helpful within continuous integration processes, to enable organizations to scan images for policy violations and vulnerabilities prior to pushing the image to an external container registry. 

In this way, the quality of container images that get to the external registry improves, and triggered activities that result from a new image appearing in the registry only happen for a good reason.

Generate a namespace and extract the token name of the

export NSINTEGRATION="integration-internal-registry"

oc new-project $NSINTEGRATION

SECRET_TOKEN_NAME=$(oc get sa -n $NSINTEGRATION default -o jsonpath='{.secrets[*]}' | jq -r .name | grep token)

PIPELINE_TOKEN=$(oc get secret -n $NSINTEGRATION $SECRET_TOKEN_NAME -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
echo $PIPELINE_TOKEN

=== Configure RHACS integration for Internal Openshift Registry

To allow the roxctl command line interface to scan the images within the OpenShift registry, add an integration of type “Generic Docker Registry'', from the Platform Configuration - Integrations menu.

Fill in the fields as shown in figure 1, giving the integration a unique name that should include the cluster name for practicality. Paste in the username and token and select Disable TLS certificate validation if you need insecure https communication to a test cluster, for example.

Press the test button to validate the connection and press “save” when the test is successful.

[#integrate_acs_slack]
== Integrate RHACS Notifications with Slack

If you are using Slack, you can forward alerts from Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes to Slack.

Create a new Slack app, enable incoming webhooks, and get a webhook URL. 

To do this step, follow the https://docs.openshift.com/acs/integration/integrate-with-slack.html#configure-slack_integrate-with-slack[Configuration Slack documentation guide] for generate a slack channel and the webhook url into the Slack workspace.

On the RHACS portal, navigate to Platform Configuration -> Integrations.

image::integrations/04-integration-slack.png[ACS Integrations Slack 1, 800]

Create a new integration in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes by using the webhook URL.

image::integrations/05-integrations-slack.png[ACS Integrations Slack 2, 600]

NOTE: the webhook URL will have the format of "https://hooks.slack.com/services/ZZZ/YYY/XXX"

Click Test and check the Slack Channel:

image::integrations/07-integrations-slack.png[ACS Integrations Slack 3, 500]

NOTE: by default all the notifications in the system policies are disabled. If you have not configured any other integrations, you will see No notifiers configured!.

For enable the Policy Notifications, select a System Policy and click on Actions, then Enable Notification:

image::integrations/08-integrations-slack.png[ACS Integrations Slack 4, 700]

Then in the System Policy selected, in the Notification will appear the Slack notification that it's enabled.

image::integrations/06-integrations-slack.png[ACS Integrations Slack 5, 600]

When a System Policy is violated, and appears in Violations, will be sent a Notification to Slack though the Slack integration notifier showing the information of the System Policy violated and more details about that:
