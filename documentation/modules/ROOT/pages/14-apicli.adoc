== RHACS CLI Overview

Within RHACS ecosystem, roxctl is a command-line interface (CLI) for running commands on Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes. 

You can install the roxctl CLI to interact with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes from a command-line interface. You can install roxctl on Linux, Windows, or macOS. Follow the https://docs.openshift.com/acs/3.70/cli/getting-started-cli.html#install-roxctl-cli-binary[guide] for installing roxtctl in your system.

For authentication, you can use an authentication token or your administrator password. 

NOTE: Red Hat recommends using an authentication token in a production environment because each token is assigned specific access control permissions.
