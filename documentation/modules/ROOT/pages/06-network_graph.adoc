== Network Graph Overview

The Network Graph is a flow diagram, firewall diagram, and firewall rule builder in one.

In the upper left you’ll see the dropdown for clusters so I can easily navigate between any of the clusters that are connected to ACS.

The default view, Active, shows me actual traffic for the Past Hour between the deployments in all of the namespaces.

You can change the time frame in the upper right dropdown, and the legend at bottom left 



With ACS setup complete and some running workloads, you should see data being populated in the ACS UI. Navigate to the Network tab to see a graph of active and allowed network connections among the namespaces and the deployments.

Zoom into the microservices-demo namespace and click on one of the deployments. On the right hand side you’ll see the deployment details.
