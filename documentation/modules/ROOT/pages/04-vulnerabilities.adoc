[#vulnerability_management_panel]
== Vulnerability Management main panel

Let’s start with Vulnerability Management, a familiar topic for most security teams.

The overview provides several important reports - where the vulnerabilities are, which are the most widespread or the most recent, where my Docker images are coming from, and important vulnerabilities in OpenShift itself.

More important than fixing any one vulnerability is establishing a process to keep container images updated and to prevent the promotion through the pipeline for images that have serious, fixable vulnerabilities.

In the upper right, you’ll see buttons to link you to all policies, CVEs, and images, and a menu to bring you to reports by cluster, namespace, deployment, and component.

Point out the Top Riskiest Images panel in the upper right

[#image_overview_image_details]
== Image overview and image details


In Top Riskiest Images, images are listed here in order of risk, based on the number and severity of the vulnerabilities present in the components in the images.

Lets see it:

image::vulnerabilities/top-riskiest-images.png[Top Riskies Images]

We can see the images which are more exposed. Not only we can see the number of CVEs affecting the images but which of them are fixable. You can click and get information about the CVEs and the fixable ones.

In the Top Riskiest Images, click on #4, redis-32-rhel7:latest.

ACS’ built-in vulnerability scanner breaks down images into layers and components - where components can be operating-system installed packages, or dependencies installed by programming languages like Python, Javascript, or Java.

The Image Summary provides the important security details of the image overall, with links to the components.

You can also see, at the top, the warning that CVE data is stale - that this image has a base OS version whose distribution has stopped providing security information on, and has likely stopped publishing security fixes for.

At the bottom, the Image Findings section focuses on Fixable vulnerabilities, sorted by CVSS.
Under the Image Findings section, Click on Dockerfile tab 

The Dockerfile tab view shows the layer-by-layer view, starting from the base image.
This image shows us a serious security problem - the base image was imported more than three years ago and even the most recent layers are more than two years old.
Time is not kind to images and components - as vulnerabilities are discovered, ACS will display newly discovered CVEs.
