== Configuration Management Overview

Every OpenShift Container Platform cluster includes many different entities distributed throughout the cluster, which makes it more challenging to understand and act on the available information.

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) provides efficient configuration management that combines all these distributed entities on a single page. It brings together information about all your clusters, namespaces, nodes, deployments, images, secrets, users, groups, service accounts, and roles in a single Configuration Management view, helping you visualize different entities and the connections between them.
